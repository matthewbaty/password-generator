## Usage

This application can be used to generate a random password. It starts by asking how many characters do you want your password to be, it then asks about uppercase, lowercase, and special characters. It also asks about numbers. If your answers do not meet the length criteria, or if you don't select at least one character type, a message will appear on the screen and let the user know they need to answer the questions again.
